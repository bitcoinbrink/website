title: 2023 Brink Annual Report
---

Our generous sponsors enabled Brink to fund seven Bitcoin Core
developers as of the end of 2023, including allowing many of them to
work together in a shared office in London.  They work in public on open
source software, so anyone at any time can see all that they've
accomplished, but in the following pages we summarize their major
achievements for 2023 and share what they're excited about working on
for 2024.

We focus on the quantity and quality of each engineer's code review and
testing before we look at any other contributions they made.  This is a
deliberate decision.  We frequently hear that many open source
contributors worry that they will only receive offers if they pursue
headline-grabbing projects, rather than quietly performing the
high-quality code reviews and testing that are essential to keeping
Bitcoin Core secure and getting useful changes merged quickly.  As an
organization, Brink always puts review and testing first and foremost,
and we've tried to reflect that part of our internal culture in this
external report.

The end of this report also includes financial information about Brink,
information about the work performed by our executive director and our
operations manager during 2023, and details about the make up of our
board and our grant committee---everything you'd typically expect to
find in a charitable organization's annual report.  But Brink's primary
mission is to find amazing Bitcoin developers and fund them on behalf of
our sponsors, and we couldn't be more excited to start this report by
showcasing all that they've accomplished in 2023.

## 2023 developer highlights

_These are the highlights.  For details about each developer's
work, see later in this report._

Sebastian Falbesoner
: left over 300 review comments as a part-time engineer, many of them
  focused on version 2 encrypted peer-to-peer transport.  He also began
  contributing to the libsecp256k1 cryptographic library used by Bitcoin
  Core and several other security-focused projects.

Michael Ford
: continued his role as project maintainer, leaving almost 1,600
  review comments, merging an average of 11 pull requests a week, and
  releasing every 2023 version of Bitcoin Core.  He helped lead several
  efforts to modernize Bitcoin Core's build toolchain.

Niklas Gögge
: left over 500 review comments, publicized several responsible disclosures
  he had made of serious vulnerabilities, found multiple new bugs in
  Bitcoin Core pull requests before they were merged, significantly
  extended Bitcoin Core's testing infrastructure, and made several
  safety-focused changes to Bitcoin Core's code.

Fabian Jahr
: left over 200 review comments after joining Brink mid-2023, led major
  improvements to distributed generation of ASMap files, wrote
  proof-of-concept code for batch validation of schnorr signatures,
  researched cross-input signature aggregation, and added significant
  resiliency to Bitcoin Core's code hosting.

Hennadii Stepanov
: left almost 1,300 review comments, contributing greatly to the
  project's effort to modernize its build tool chain, and continued his
  role as the project's GUI maintainer.  He also continued working with the
  Bitcoin Design Community on a reference GUI wallet design compatible
  with Bitcoin Core.

Stéphan Vuylsteke
: left almost 600 review comments, earning special commendation from his
  peers for his diligence and follow up.  He continued contributing to multiple
  education and mentorship efforts, including Qala, London BitDevs, and
  the Bitcoin Core Pull Request Review Club.

Gloria Zhao
: continued her role as mempool/P2P system maintainer, leaving 900 review
  comments and leading the work on package relay.  She was also a
  leading contributor to TRUC (v3) transactions and ancestor-aware funding.  She
  gave multiple talks at Bitcoin conferences, co-maintains the Bitcoin
  Core Pull Request Review Club, and helps mentor several new Bitcoin
  Core contributors.
