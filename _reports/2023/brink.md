# Organizational Updates

![](img/brink_logo.png)

We led with, and focused, this annual report on the engineering work
accomplished by Brink-funded developers throughout the year, as their efforts
directly further our mission of strengthening the Bitcoin software, protocol,
and network. As a non-profit organization with no revenues, we rely entirely on
community support and our generous sponsors to achieve our mission.

Thanks to the strong support of the community’s contributions, we achieved
significant growth across our organizational programs. While the bulk of this
report has largely focused on our engineering output and achievements, we will
now provide a summary of the financial aspects of our efforts.

*Note: For clarity, the figures provided are approximations based on the cash
method for 2023. Audited, accrual-based GAAP financials will be available in our
public 2023 Form 990 filing.*

## Fundraising

Brink’s sponsors donated approximately $2,400,000 toward our mission in 2023.
These contributions came from over 500 different donors and included
approximately 2.5 BTC in donations.

Thanks to the early financial contributions from our Founding Sponsors---Wences
Casares, John Pfeffer, and an anonymous donor---Brink’s operating costs were fully
covered in 2023, **allowing 100% of all new donations to go directly to our
programs**.

Our major donors, who contributed over $5,000 each, played a crucial role in our
success. We’d like to thank them publicly:

* Startsmall: $1,000,000
* Marathon Digital Holdings: $500,000
* The Draper Foundation: $250,000
* Samara Asset Group / Cryptology: $150,000
* Anonymous: $125,830
* Chun Wang: $100,000
* Stakwork / LND: $60,000
* Lightspark Group, Inc.: $50,000
* BitMEX/HDR Global Trading: $50,000
* Ledger: $15,945
* Van Eck Associates Corporation: $10,000 (plus a future pledge of 5% profits
  from VanEck Bitcoin Trust ETF for at least 10 years)
* CleanSpark Inc.: $10,000
* Anonymous: $9,725
* Anonymous: $5,000

Brink is thankful for our diverse donor base, which includes high-net-worth
individuals, Bitcoin miners, Bitcoin mining pool operators, venture capitalists,
Lightning businesses, hardware device manufacturers, family offices, exchanges,
and hundreds of individual donors. In 2023, we not only diversified our donor
base, but the majority of new donors were also first-time supporters of Brink---a
testament to the quality and reputation of our engineers’ work and our broader
community outreach efforts. Thank you all for your support!

### Bitcoin 2023 Matching Fundraising Event

We launched our first matching campaign in 2023, thanks to a generous $500,000
match from our partners at Marathon during the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami.
The campaign ran from the start of the conference through the end of the year,
offering a $2 match for every $1 donated during the conference and a $1 match
thereafter. The community responded enthusiastically, and the full $500,000
match was met within the three days of the conference, raising over $800,000 for
our developer funding initiatives. The successful collaboration between
individual donors and a major Bitcoin business was a notable achievement, and
we’ll certainly consider it for future campaigns.

### Recurring Pledges

With a strong track record of funding talented Bitcoin developers, Brink earned
the trust of several donors in 2023 who made multi-year pledges to support our
mission. We are deeply grateful to these donors, whose pledged commitments help
make our mission and the careers of the engineers we support more sustainable:

* Startsmall: $5,000,000 ($1,000,000 annual commitment for 5 years)
* Samara Asset Group / Cryptology: $450,000 ($150,000 annual commitment for 3
  years)
* Stakwork / LND: $180,000 ($60,000 annual commitment for 3 years)
* Lightspark Group, Inc: $150,000 ($50,000 annual commitment for 3 years)
* VanEck Associate Corporation: Pledged 5% of future profits from VanEck Bitcoin
  Trust ETF (HODL) for at least 10 years
* Bitwise Asset Management: Pledged 3.33% of  future profits from Bitwise
  Bitcoin ETF (BITB) for at least 10 years

### Fundraising for the Bitcoin Core Developer Meetings

Twice a year, Bitcoin Core developers gather for in-person meetings to share
knowledge, review code, present ideas, and collaborate. Separate from Brink’s
fundraising for our grants and fellowship programs, Executive Director Mike
Schmidt also fundraises specifically for these developer meetings.

Thanks to generous donations from Spiral and OpenSats, we helped to successfully
organize two in-person Bitcoin Core developer meetings in 2023:

* Spiral/Block Inc: $25,000 for a three-day event in Dublin, Ireland
* OpenSats: $21,000 for a four-day event in Azores, Portugal

More information about Bitcoin Core developer meetings is available on the
[https://coredev.tech/][coredev tech] website. Here you will find
summaries of both the [Dublin][coredev dublin] and [Azores][coredev azores] meetings.

## Expenses

In 2023, Brink's expenses were approximately $1,600,000. The breakdown of these
expenses include:

* **Program: Developer Funding ($1,220,000)**
  * Developer Salaries & Grants ($1,100,000)
  * Travel ($35,000)
  * Office ($85,000)
* **Program: General Bitcoin Core Support ($16,000)**
* **Program: Bitcoin Core Developer Meetings ($41,000)**
* **Program: Bitcoin Optech ($14,000)**
* **Operations, Staff, and Fundraising ($309,000)**
  * Staff Compensation ($200,000)
  * Operational expenses ($92,000)
  * Fundraising ($17,000)

As an organization, we are proud to have 81% of our expenses going directly
toward our programs. This high program expense ratio reflects our dedication to
supporting Bitcoin development and ensuring that the majority of our funds are
used for program-related activities. We thank our sponsors who have covered our
operational expenses so that all new donations can 100% go toward our programs.

### Developer Salaries & Grants

Brink’s primary program is to fund Bitcoin engineers working on open source
Bitcoin software. In 2023, the grants / wages for these engineers totaled
$1,100,000.

This total includes various benefits and costs as part of their compensation
package, including:

* Visa expenses
* Pension contributions
* Healthcare costs
* Computer hardware
* Taxes

### Travel Expenses

In addition to compensation for their work, Brink provides a travel subsidy for
each engineer. In 2023, Brink covered flights and hotel expenses for all of our
Bitcoin Core engineers to attend the Core Developer meetings in Dublin and the
Azores.

We were also pleased to fund other engineer travel to Bitcoin developer events
throughout the year, depending on the engineers’ interests or area of expertise.
This included covering travel costs, lodging, and conference tickets for
engineers who attended or presented at Bitcoin 2023 Miami, BTC Azores, Advancing
Bitcoin, the Africa Bitcoin Conference in Ghana, TabConf, the Lightning Summit,
and BTC Prague.

The total expenses for travel, lodging, and tickets for engineers in 2023
amounted to approximately $35,000.

### Office Expenses

In 2023, Brink sponsored seven engineers, with five based in our London office
and two working remotely. We are pleased to offer this flexibility for engineers
who prefer either a collaborative office setting or the option to work remotely.

To facilitate their work in London, Brink covers various expenses, including
office and meeting space costs, as well as necessary equipment. We also provide
space for colleagues to visit for collaboration and idea sharing.

The total office-related expenses, including rent, insurance, software, and
other supplies, in 2023 amounted to $85,000.

### General Bitcoin Core Support

In 2023, Brink began financially sponsoring some of the infrastructure
supporting the Bitcoin Core project. Our deep involvement in the project means
we understand what specific ways we can add value and help developers.
Previously, these compute and server resources were often paid out-of-pocket by
individual contributors to support essential functions like continuous
integration, the build system, and testing infrastructure. Sponsoring this
infrastructure is both cost-effective and high leverage in that it helps find
more bugs (in the case of fuzz testing) and results in a faster developer
experience (in the case of continuous integration) but can represent a huge cost
to an individual. Brink is happy to relieve Bitcoin Core contributors of this
administrative and financial burden, whether they are Brink-funded engineers or
not. In all cases, the contributors retain control of the servers and the
autonomy to use them as they see fit for the project.

The total expenses for server and cloud hosting for Bitcoin Core engineers was
$16,000.

### Bitcoin Core Developer Meetings

The fundraising and management of funds for the Core Developer meetings are
distinct from Brink’s other programs. Each event incurs several types of
expenses, including:

* Venue rental for 3-4 days
* Meals, snacks, coffee, and beverages during the meeting
* Travel expenses (flights, hotels) for attendees not sponsored by other means
* Swag (hats, shirts, hoodies, stickers)
* Meeting materials (electrical & AV, equipment rentals, office supplies, etc.)

The total spent for Core Developer meetings in 2023 was $41,000. Unspent funds
are reserved for future Core Developer meetings.

### Bitcoin Optech

Although Bitcoin Optech predates Brink, Brink handles the administration of
Optech’s expenses, which include web hosting fees for bitcoinops.org, email
services for the weekly newsletter, and transcription services for the podcast.

The total expenses for Optech in 2023 were $14,000.

### Brink Operations and Staff

In 2023, the Brink Operations team consisted of Mike Schmidt, Executive
Director, and Emily Kee, Operations & UK Office Manager. This team is
responsible for managing day-to-day activities and ensuring that the non-profit
operates efficiently. Their responsibilities include administrative management,
financial management, human resources, event coordination, fundraising and donor
management, and communications and public relations.

Total Expenses for Staff Compensation, Operational Expenses, and Fundraising for
2023 total $309,000:

* Staff Compensation (Emily and Mike): $200,000
* Fundraising (travel, events, swag): $17,000
* Operational expenses (banking, accounting, auditing, legal, supplies,
  insurance): $92,000.

Brink conducts voluntary annual audits to ensure transparency and
accountability. In 2023, we completed our 2022 audit with Rogers & Co., which
was conducted in accordance with US generally accepted auditing standards. We
were found to be compliant.

IRS or UK filing history listed on [Companies House][uk companies house].

## Team

### Board

The Brink Board oversees Brink Technology Inc., the 501(c)(3) non-profit
organization, and is Brink’s ultimate governing body. In 2023, we were pleased
to announce that [Jonathan Bier joined Brink’s Board][bier blog]. With his role
administering the BitMEX Open Source Developer Grant Program, long-time
experience in the ecosystem, and industry connections, he is a valuable addition
to the Board. Jonathan joins Executive Director Mike Schmidt and long-time
Bitcoin and Lightning open source contributor Christian Decker on the Board.

In early 2023, Jerry Brito wrapped up his two-year term on the Board. Jerry
brought his experience as Executive Director at Coin Center to help build the
foundation of the organization in those formative first two years. We thank
Jerry for his valuable contributions.

### Grant Committee

After forming a separate, specialized Grant Committee in 2022, Brink was
fortunate to add engineer Gloria Zhao to the committee in 2023. Gloria joined
existing Committee members Mike Schmidt, Christian Decker, and long-time Bitcoin
technologist David Harding.

With the Committee responsible for evaluating new engineering grant applications
and assessing progress of existing engineers, Gloria’s role as a maintainer of
the Bitcoin Core project is a significant addition. Her perspectives and
in-depth, day-to-day technical knowledge of the Bitcoin Core codebase, adds to
an already robust set of Committee members.

### Emily Kee

![](img/emily-kee.jpg)

Emily Kee, Brink’s Office & Operations Manager, made significant contributions
in financial oversight, corporate compliance, event planning, and fostering
employee morale.

As Operations Manager, Emily took a proactive role in financial oversight,
thoroughly reviewing Brink’s accounts in both the US and UK. Her efforts led to
increased transparency, accuracy, and stronger financial stewardship.
Additionally, she played a key role in reviewing and producing the necessary
documentation for Brink’s voluntary 2022 audit and 990 filings.

Emily streamlined the onboarding process for all grant recipients and employees
at Brink, ensuring that everyone felt welcomed, supported, and equipped to be
productive, while maintaining full compliance with US and UK regulations.

Her coordination was instrumental in the success of the CoreDev meetings in
Dublin and The Azores, keeping both events under budget and earning positive
feedback from participants.

From onboarding to addressing daily HR inquiries and organizing holiday parties,
Emily's leadership as London’s Office Manager brought stability, transparency,
and trust, enabling the office to thrive.

In 2024, Emily will continue to focus on enhancing financial transparency
through the voluntary 2023 audit, reviewing existing operational procedures to
identify efficiency gaps, reduce unnecessary spending, and steward donor funds
responsibly.

### Mike Schmidt

![](img/mike-schmidt.png)

As Executive Director, Mike Schmidt works with Brink’s Board to lead the
organization in fulfilling our mission “*to strengthen the Bitcoin protocol and
network through fundamental research and development, and to support the Bitcoin
developer community through funding, education, and mentoring*”.

His most important responsibilities include:

* Building a Board, Grant Committee, and operational team that can efficiently
  execute on our mission
* Recruiting and retaining top engineering talent that is most beneficial for
  Bitcoin
* Fundraising to support and sustain Brink engineers and operations long into
  the future

Adding Jonathan Bier to the Brink’s Board and Gloria Zhao to the Grant Committee
enhanced two already strong groups governing Brink’s operations.

We were fortunate to add Fabian Jahr as a full-time remote grantee in 2023,
while retaining six of Brink’s existing long-time engineers.

After a challenging fundraising year in 2022 during the Bitcoin bear market,
Mike successfully drove the fundraising initiatives discussed above, resulting
in an increase in our reserves by the end of 2023.

To be efficient with both engineers’ and Brink’s Grant Committee’s time, Mike,
with valuable HR assistance from Emily, revamped the yearly review process for
engineers, resulting in a more streamlined and standardized approach. This new
process, served as the foundation of the engineering summaries in this report.

Mike also led a new initiative in 2023 to publish relevant Brink technical
engineering calls for public consumption. Recognizing the valuable content in
our monthly internal video calls, Mike began recording, editing, and publishing
these calls on [Brink’s new YouTube channel][brink youtube] to share knowledge
with the broader community.

While much of Mike’s time is dedicated to fundraising and operational work, he
also significantly contributes towards Brink’s programs.

He contributes to, reviews, and publishes the weekly Bitcoin Optech newsletter,
primarily authored by Brink Grant Committee member and [Mastering
Bitcoin][mastering bitcoin] author David Harding. Alongside Bitcoin Core
contributor Mark Erhardt (Murch), Mike co-hosts the Bitcoin Optech Podcast, a
weekly audio discussion of the technical Bitcoin and Lightning developments
covered in the Optech newsletter. Including the translation reviews, this totals
51 newsletters published, 51 podcasts recorded with leading Bitcoin and
Lightning engineers, coordination on 51 podcast transcriptions, and review of
204 newsletter language translations.

Having organized three  Bitcoin Core Developer meetings previously, Mike, with
strong support from Emily Kee, Adam Jonas from Chaincode, and sponsors Spiral
and OpenSats, organized two more successful developer meetings in 2023.

In 2024, Mike will continue to prioritize Brink’s fundraising initiatives while
contributing to Bitcoin Optech, organizing Bitcoin Core developer meetings, and
working with Emily to ensure the efficient operation of the organization.

## Outlook

While 2023 was a strong year for Brink and the engineers we support, there is
always more and better work to be done.

With engineers at the core of our mission, we aim not only to continue
supporting our existing talented Bitcoin engineering team  but also expand
support,  especially in areas like education, training, and networking
opportunities.

By building out our reserves, we can extend the organization’s runway  and
provide job security and sustainability for engineers, which we hope will result
in longer-term retention of talented engineers. If financial conditions allow,
we would also love to be able to onboard one or more new engineers to Brink.

We all want to see a stronger, more resilient Bitcoin network. As outlined in
this report, Brink engineers made substantial progress in improving the
foundational Bitcoin infrastructure in 2023 and have already made significant
progress in 2024 towards that end. We are grateful for all of the
Brink-sponsored engineers’ work and thank all of Brink’s sponsors for empowering
us to achieve this mission!
