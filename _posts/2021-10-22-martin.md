Today, we’re excited to announce our second Brink fellow. [Martin
Zumsande][mzumsande] will be joining Brink in our London office from
December 2021 to work full time on open
source Bitcoin protocol development. Martin’s fellowship is generously
supported by [Gemini][gemini].

## About Martin

Martin is from Osnabrück, Germany. He's been contributing to Bitcoin Core since
early 2019, and in that time has reviewed over 50 PRs and had 15 PRs merged.
He's hosted Bitcoin Core review club 5 times, and has already become an expert
on address relay in Bitcoin Core.

Martin will initially focus his efforts on reviewing and improving address relay
in Bitcoin Core, a crucial function that protects Bitcoin nodes from being
eclipsed by malicious third parties. He also intends to continue focusing on
review and testing open pull requests.

In his spare time, Martin enjoys playing chess and competes as an International
Master.
