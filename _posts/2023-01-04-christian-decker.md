Brink is thrilled to announce our newest board member: Christian Decker, PhD.
Christian will serve on our board for a term of two years. He will also serve on
Brink’s recently formed grant committee evaluating grant applications as well as
existing grantee technical contributions.

Christian is an early adopter of Bitcoin, having joined in 2009. In 2012 his
hobby became his job by writing the world's first dissertation on Bitcoin.
Decker’s focus is on improving the understanding of underlying consensus
mechanisms while making Bitcoin scalable and his research has resulted in
numerous publications. After his PhD he joined Blockstream where to this date
he's working on the Lightning Network specification, as well as the
Core-Lightning implementation.

Christian brings with him Bitcoin and Lightning technical expertise and insight
to both the board as well as the grant committee.

Please join us in welcoming Christian!
