The promise of Bitcoin is only as secure as the cryptographic keys that
authenticate its operations: they are the keys to freedom in the digital age.
However, the requirements for Bitcoin key management are becoming more demanding
with innovative off-chain protocols such as the [Lightning Network][ln] and
[Discreet Log Contracts][dlc] that introduce new roles and responsibilities for
keys.

Off-chain protocols facilitate smart contracts that are highly scalable and
private, which enable a vast array of new markets and financial instruments.
However, many of these protocols present challenges from a key management
perspective because they rely on “hot” keys that must be readily accessible and
frequently reused, unlike safer "cold" keys that are rarely accessed and never
reused. With the introduction of [Taproot][taproot], we can begin to bridge this
divide between a "hot" and "cold" key by leveraging distributed key generation
and threshold signing.

Distributed key generation is a cryptographic protocol in which parties use
secure multi-party computation ([MPC][mpc wiki]) to generate a public/private
key pair in such a way that no party learns the private key. Instead, each party
learns a "share" of the private key, and when a threshold of these parties
cooperate they can use their shares to generate signatures for the key. The
threshold is configured by the parties when the key is generated. For example,
if 5 parties generated a key with a threshold of 3, then at least 3 of the
parties would need to cooperate to produce a signature (i.e. 3-of-5).

This means that for the entire lifecycle of the private key–from generation to
expiration–it is never constructed or represented on any device in any form
(assuming a threshold of shares has not been compromised). With Taproot, we can
leverage the linearity of Schnorr signatures to perform signing with 3
communication rounds (or 2 rounds with limited concurrency). This is in contrast
to ECDSA multisignature schemes, which are complex and require many more rounds.
And with the recent invention of Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold
Signatures ([FROST][frost whitepaper]), signing can even be done in a single
round, with unlimited concurrency.

With FROST, a single Schnorr signature is generated that is indistinguishable
from a signature that is generated by a single party. An outside observer,
solely by analyzing the data in the blockchain, cannot detect that a multi-party
scheme was used to generate the signature. This makes FROST favorable from a
scaling perspective because regardless of how many parties were involved in
signature generation, the blockchain only stores a single signature that is
always the same size. In this way, privacy and scalability work hand in hand.

FROST is a relatively new scheme yet some notable open-source implementations
have already been developed, such as [frost][frost ckomlo git] and
[frost-dalek][frost dalek github], two Rust implementations using the Ristretto
group, [frost-ed25519][frost ed25519 github], a Go implementation using Ed25519,
and [redjubjub][redjubjub github], a Rust implementation using Jubjub. However,
none of these implementations are currently compatible with Bitcoin, which uses
secp256k1 and BIP-340 Schnorr signatures. My plan is to implement a
Bitcoin-compatible FROST in C built on [secp256k1-zkp][secp256k1-zkp github].

I’m currently in the early stages of the project and I’m focusing on gathering
feedback and drafting specifications. I will be sharing a detailed roadmap and
timeline soon. Follow [Brink][brink twitter] and [subscribe to the
