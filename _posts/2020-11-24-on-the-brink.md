We're excited to announce a new independent nonprofit organization to support
open source development for Bitcoin and related technologies. Brink will
support established developers through a grant program and onboard new
contributors through a fellowship program. These programs will help address the
most pressing issues facing the Bitcoin project: how to sustainably fund open
source protocol developers, and how to bring new developers into Bitcoin
protocol development.

Brink is founded by [John Newbery][] and [Mike Schmidt][]. They are joined on
the board by independent director [Dave Harding][]. The Brink team will foster
relationships with individual donors and sponsoring organizations, administer
developer grants, and mentor exceptionally talented new contributors. [John
Pfeffer][] and [Wences Casares][] have generously provided organizational
funding. [The Human Rights Foundation][], [Square Crypto][] and [Gemini][] are
funding our first two fellows, and [Kraken][] is sponsoring our first grantee.
We are actively seeking additional funding, grant recipients, and fellows.

Brink offers a new model for onboarding and funding protocol developers, with
many advantages:

- Grant applicants will be judged by the Brink board solely on their
  contribution history and potential. Recipients will have no obligations to
  any sponsoring corporation or individual.

- The Brink team’s history of high-quality, impactful contributions ensures
  that sponsoring organizations and individuals can be confident that their
  donations will be used effectively, without having to go through the
  time-consuming process of vetting, assessing, and administering direct grants.

- We have applied for 501(c)(3) designation in the United States, which will
  allow U.S. taxpayers to make tax exempt donations to the organization. We
  will be the only organization solely devoted to Bitcoin development that takes
  direct donations from the public in this way.

- Brink’s commitment to onboarding and mentoring new contributors supports the
  long-term health of Bitcoin protocol development.

We believe that Brink’s unique model of funding, grant awards, and focus on
mentoring will further decentralize Bitcoin’s protocol development and
strengthen the Bitcoin network and developer ecosystem.
