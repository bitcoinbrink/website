Brink is proud to announce the recipients of its first round of open source developer grants.
After an open grant application process, the [Brink board of directors][brink board] has selected three
developers who have demonstrated continued commitment to open source Bitcoin protocol
development. Their work spans fundamental cryptographic engineering, application tooling,
and base layer development and maintenance. Brink supports each of these developers to
work **full time** on open source development. The three grant recipients are:

## Jesse Posner

Jesse’s funding supports his work on [adaptor signatures][] and an implementation of the
[FROST threshold signature scheme][frost]. These technologies bring additional security, privacy
and functionality to multisignature and second layer protocols.

Alekos's funding supports his work as maintainer of the [Bitcoin Dev Kit][bdk], a
lightweight and modular collection of tools for use by wallets and other Bitcoin applications.

Hennadii has been contributing code and review to Bitcoin Core since 2018. In that time he
has become [one of the most prolific contributors to the project][hebasto]. Hennadii’s funding allows
him to work full time on Bitcoin Core development and review. Hennadii has previously
received support from [CardCoins][] and [Payvant][payvant].
