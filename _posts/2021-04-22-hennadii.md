_We talked to Brink grant recipient Hennadii Stepanov about how he started
contributing to Bitcoin Core and his priorities for the next year._

I first heard about Bitcoin from friends at the beginning of 2017. I had some
Linux system admin experience and at the time was maintaining a Java-based GUI
of an accounting application for a credit union. Eventually, I spun up an old
laptop to run Bitcoin Core but the laptop happened to have a small HDD and space
was limited. I discovered that Bitcoin Core had a pruning option, which I tried
using. While reviewing the related code, I spotted a bug in the documentation
and decided to file my first Bitcoin Core pull request, [#13844][bitcoin core 13844]. It
was merged and I was encouraged to see that I could help make improvements to
the codebase.

Over [500 commits][hebasto commits] later and much like that first PR, I find
that most of my contributions are motivated by my personal experience as a Core
user. I mostly contribute to the GUI (where I was recently made [a
maintainer][bitcoin core 21615]), peer-to-peer code, concurrency code, and the build
system. I am excited to continue contributing to Bitcoin Core and have a few
different areas of focus over the next year.

First and foremost I plan to use my time reviewing as many PRs as possible.
Reviews can be scarce on the project and for such a security-critical
application, it’s vitally important that all code changes are thoroughly
reviewed.

I’m excited about the build system and the idea of an automated process for
[bootstrappable builds][bootstrappable website] on different architectures. I
look forward to working with Carl Dong and using [Guix for releases][bitcoin github guix].

I also have a few goals for the Bitcoin Core GUI. The first is to migrate our
GUI to use [Qt Modeling Language][qml wiki] (QML). QML is a declarative language
and is a much more recognizable framework for Javascript and CSS developers than
the existing QT code. By using QML, we can hopefully lure more contributors to
the GUI repo. My second goal is to increase the GUI responsiveness as the
current GUI can be slow and unresponsive at times. The final goal is to finish
the [Developer Notes for Qt Code][bitcoin qt notes] wiki documentation that I’ve
begun working on. This documentation will help streamline contributions and
onboard new developers.

In the peer-to-peer code, I’ll spend some time researching additional criteria for estimating the quality of a node’s peers. I hope to decrease the number of different heuristics currently being used and to simplify peer scoring.

Lastly, I will continue to keep the [Ukrainian language translation][transifex
bitcoin] for the Bitcoin Core project up to date since it was previously
abandoned.

I’m proud of the contributions I made while [sponsored by CardCoins and
Payvant][cardcoins hebasto blog] and look forward to continuing my work with
Brink’s support.
