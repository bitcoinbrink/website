When we founded Brink in 2020, “move fast and break things” for-profit crypto
companies were rampant and a “move slow and fix things” Bitcoin non-profit was a
low time preference outlier. Now our approach has been thoroughly validated and
continues to guide our mission: ensuring that Bitcoin Core contributors have the
long-term stability, resources, and community support they need to do their best
work hardening this monetary network.

Having recently completed our 2024 accounting audit process, we have compiled Brink's 2024
annual organizational and financial report.

We provide some highlights from the report below, with the [full report
available here][2024 annual report].

## Fundraising

Brink’s donors contributed approximately $6,500,000 toward our mission last year.
These contributions came from over 500 different donors.

In the [report][2024 annual report], we list all of our major donors, who contributed over $5,000
each, and thank them for the crucial role they played in our success.

## Expenses

## Organizational Highlights

While more details are available in the [full report][2024 annual report], we
wanted to summarize some of the organizational initiatives that we are proud of.

### Our Newest Fellow: Marco De Leon

We were thrilled to welcome a new Brink Fellow in 2024, Marco De Leon
(marcofleon). Throughout the year, he has received direct in person mentorship from Niklas
Gögge (dergoegge) working on Bitcoin Core’s fuzz testing infrastructure.

### Developer Visits to Brink

We’ve increasingly opened our London office as a collaborative hub for
visiting contributors. In 2024, we invited individual contributors
to join us for extended stays to collaborate. Brink paid travel and
accommodations to engineers funded elsewhere to join us in London.

### Bitcoin Core Developer Meetings

In 2024, Brink staff, in collaboration with other organizers, supported the
Bitcoin Core ”CoreDev Meetings” by fundraising and helping organize two in-person
gatherings for Bitcoin Core developers in Lisbon, Portugal and Berlin, Germany.
These meetings are essential for collaboration, knowledge sharing, and
strengthening the open-source community behind the Bitcoin protocol.

### Bitcoin Optech

In 2024, Brink continued to support Bitcoin Optech by assisting with financial
management and fundraising efforts. While Optech is an independent community
initiative, we’re proud to play a supporting role in helping it thrive.

## Outlook

Even with Brink’s “move slow and fix things” mentality, we have initiatives we
are excited about in 2025 and beyond including a third party security audit, a
bug bounty program, and further expanded testing capabilities.

These new initiatives build on our core focus to support the engineers doing the
critical and often-thankless work of maintaining and advancing Bitcoin’s
open-source foundations. It is only because of the generous support from our
donors that we are able to continue to expand the project's capabilities. Brink
is honored to play a role in this work.

To our donors, partners, engineers, volunteers, and community members, thank you
for helping strengthen Bitcoin for future generations.

Executive Director
