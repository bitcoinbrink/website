---

Founded in September of 2020, Brink has officially made it through our first
Bitcoin 4-year cycle. As we celebrate our 4 year anniversary, we have compiled
our first annual report highlighting engineering accomplishments in 2023,
engineer's progress and plans during 2024, and details of Brink's fundraising
and expenses.

We hope this report provides tangible insights into progress made on Bitcoin's open
source codebase, by Brink engineers, that is often hard to assess or quantify.

We provide some highlights from the report below, with the [full report
available here][2023 annual report].

## Organizational Updates

### Fundraising

Brink’s sponsors donated approximately $2,400,000 toward our mission last year.
These contributions came from over 500 different donors.

> _Brink is thankful for our diverse donor base, which includes high-net-worth
individuals, Bitcoin miners, Bitcoin mining pool operators, venture capitalists,
Lightning businesses, hardware device manufacturers, family offices, exchanges,
and hundreds of individual donors._

In the [report][2023 annual report], we list all of our major donors, who
contributed over $5,000 each, and thank them for the crucial role they played in
our success.

### Expenses

In 2023, Brink's expenses were approximately $1,600,000. The summary of these
expenses include:

* Program: Developer Funding ($1,220,000)
  * Developer Salaries & Grants ($1,100,000)
  * Travel ($35,000)
  * Office ($85,000)

method for 2023. Audited, accrual-based GAAP financials will be available in our
public 2023 Form 990 filing._

## Engineering Highlights

We focus on the quantity and quality of each engineer's code review and testing
before we look at any other contributions they made.  This is a deliberate
decision.  We frequently hear that many open source contributors worry that they
will only receive offers if they pursue headline-grabbing projects, rather than
quietly performing the high-quality code reviews and testing that are essential
to keeping Bitcoin Core secure and getting useful changes merged quickly. While
number of review comments is far from the perfect metric, we noticed how
uncommonly large these numbers were, and wished to highlight them as a
reflection of Brink engineers' focus on review and security.  As an
organization, Brink always puts review and testing first and foremost, and we've
tried to reflect that part of our internal culture in this external
[report][2023 annual report].

### Sebastian Falbesoner

> _Left over 300 review comments as a part-time engineer, many of them
  focused on version 2 encrypted peer-to-peer transport.  He also began
  contributing to the libsecp256k1 cryptographic library used by Bitcoin
  Core and several other security-focused projects._

### Michael Ford

> _Continued his role as project maintainer, leaving almost 1,600
  review comments, merging an average of 11 pull requests a week, and
  releasing every 2023 version of Bitcoin Core.  He helped lead several
  efforts to modernize Bitcoin Core's build toolchain._

### Niklas Gögge

> _Left over 500 review comments, publicized several responsible disclosures
  he had made of serious vulnerabilities, found multiple new bugs in
  Bitcoin Core pull requests before they were merged, significantly
  extended Bitcoin Core's testing infrastructure, and made several
  safety-focused changes to Bitcoin Core's code._

### Fabian Jahr

> _Left over 200 review comments after joining Brink mid-2023, led major
  improvements to distributed generation of ASMap files, wrote
  proof-of-concept code for batch validation of schnorr signatures,
  researched cross-input signature aggregation, and added significant
  resiliency to Bitcoin Core's code hosting._

### Hennadii Stepanov

> _Left almost 1,300 review comments, contributing greatly to the
  project's effort to modernize its build tool chain, and continued his
  role as the project's GUI maintainer.  He also continued working with the
  Bitcoin Design Community on a reference GUI wallet design compatible
  with Bitcoin Core._

### Stéphan Vuylsteke

> _Left almost 600 review comments, earning special commendation from his
  peers for his diligence and follow up.  He continued contributing to multiple
  education and mentorship efforts, including Qala, London BitDevs, and
  the Bitcoin Core Pull Request Review Club._

### Gloria Zhao

> _Continued her role as mempool/P2P system maintainer, leaving 900 review
  comments and leading the work on package relay.  She was also a
  leading contributor to TRUC (v3) transactions and ancestor-aware funding.  She
  gave multiple talks at Bitcoin conferences, co-maintains the Bitcoin
  Core Pull Request Review Club, and helps mentor several new Bitcoin
  Core contributors._

While those highlights are interesting, the report contains over [17 pages][2023
annual report] of Bitcoin development updates from Brink engineers that we are
proud to showcase for the community.

## Outlook

_We all want to see a stronger, more resilient Bitcoin network. As outlined in
this report, Brink engineers made substantial progress in improving the
foundational Bitcoin infrastructure in 2023 and have already made significant
progress in 2024 towards that end. We are grateful for all of the
Brink-sponsored engineers’ work and thank all of Brink’s sponsors for empowering
us to achieve this mission!_
