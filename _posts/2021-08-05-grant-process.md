Thanks to the support of our [sponsors][brink sponsors], Brink has awarded [three full
time grants][grants1] and [two partial grants][grants2] in the past four
months.  In this post, we describe how we designed our grant program to
maximize the time developers spend working on Bitcoin and to minimize the
time they spend worrying about finding funding.

## The application

Our grant [application][brink grant application] currently contains only
three questions requiring a detailed response:

1. Describe your prior contributions to Bitcoin-related projects.

2. What will you work on during your grant and what deliverables do you
   expect to produce?

3. Is there anything else we need to know?

For any applicant with a history of open source contributions and who
already knows what they want to work on, we expect that a high-quality
application can be written in less than an hour.

## The interview

If an application looks promising, a video call is scheduled between the
applicant and one or two members of the grant committee, which currently
consists of Brink's five [board members][brink board].  Members include
experienced contributors to Bitcoin Core and LND, so we're often able to
match the applicant with a well-informed interviewer.

Although the interview necessarily includes some formalities, it's also
a chance for the applicant to talk about the parts of Bitcoin technology
that excite them the most.  We enjoy the conversations and hope that
applicants do as well.

## The offer

The grant committee meets every two to three months and evaluates all
qualified proposals based on how much we expect the deliverables will
benefit Bitcoin users, factoring in the applicant's history of
completing projects with similar scope.  After the meeting, each
applicant is sent an email either declining or accepting their proposal.
Successful applicants receive an offer for either a full-time or
part-time grant.  Part-time grant offers are tailored to the applicant's
specific circumstances.  For most other grants, our standard offer has
two key features:

1. **Personalized compensation:** every applicant has a different level
   of experience, a different history of contribution, and a proposal
   with a different degree of expected impact.  Offering every applicant
   the same amount would almost guarantee that the best contributors we
   could find would be undercompensated.  Instead, the grant committee
   uses its members' experience in software development in general, and
   Bitcoin and LN specifically, to make each applicant a compensation
   offer unique to their situation.

2. **Full time and exclusive:** our full-time grant contract forbids
   grantees from seeking additional money from other sponsors for the
   duration of the grant.  We want to make sure grantees are working
   full time on the projects described in their proposals, not trying to
   scrape together a full-time salary by applying for a succession of
   part-time grants.  Requiring exclusivity ensures that we're motivated
   to offer applicants fair compensation---and that applicants are
   motivated to only accept an offer they find entirely satisfactory.

    Of course, grantees are still free to accept spontaneous donations
    from the community and to work on side projects in their free time
    (including lightly compensated work such as speaking engagements or
    article writing).  Exclusivity means grantees shouldn't *need*
    secondary donations or side projects and that their primary focus
    should be on delivering the proposed project.  It doesn't mean that
    grantees must deny themselves the perks and career opportunities
    that come from working on problems that the wider community finds
    both interesting and important.

If the applicant accepts our offer, we typically complete the contract
and send the first quarterly grant payment to them in less than a week.

We hope this post has adequately explained how our grant program works
to get independent Bitcoin developers the funding they deserve without
unnecessary complications or delays.  If that interests you, we'd love
to receive your [application][brink grant application].
