description: A guide to donating Bitcoin to Brink.
---

Brink recently received [501(c)(3) public charity status][IRS status], allowing
US taxpayers to make tax-deductible donations to our organization. One of the
questions we often get asked is whether it's possible to donate Bitcoin to
Brink, and how to do so in a tax efficient way.

There are two significant advantages to donating Bitcoin directly rather than
selling and donating the proceeds:

- Selling Bitcoin that you've held results in capital gains tax on the
  increased value of those Bitcoin. That reduces the amount you can effectively
  donate to the charity. **Gifting the Bitcoin directly means that the charity
  benefits from the full value of the Bitcoin**.

- Your tax deduction will be for the full market value of the Bitcoin, rather
  than the amount after paying capital gains tax.

The two common ways to donate Bitcoin to nonprofits are through a donor-advised
fund, or directly (which may require a value appraisal). This post describes
both methods.

### Donor-Advised Funds

A [donor-advised fund (DAF)][DAF] is a private fund administered by a third
party and created for the purpose of managing charitable donations on behalf of
an organization, family, or individual.

DAFs have become increasingly popular, primarily because they
offer the donor greater ease of administration, while still allowing the donor
to maintain significant control over the placement and distribution of
charitable gifts. In addition, companies are able to offer this service to
clients at a lower cost than if the funds were handled privately.

There are several benefits to donating through a DAF:

* It allows the donor to better manage their tax burden. For example, the donor
  may choose to donate a large sum to maximize deductions in one tax year, and
  then spread out their charitable giving from the fund over multiple years.

* Any growth in the value of the fund is tax exempt.

* It's easy to donate [Bitcoin][Fidelity BTC] (or other appreciated assets) to the
  fund while not incurring capital gains tax.
  
By donating Bitcoin through your DAF, you will receive the tax-deductible
benefit for the value of the Bitcoin, but Brink will receive USD, not Bitcoin.
For more details, please contact your DAF portfolio manager.

The three largest DAFs are [Fidelity Charitable][Fidelity], [Schwab
Charitable][Schwab] and [BNY Mellon Charitable Gift Fund][BNY]. All three can accept
Bitcoin donations.

If you have an established account with one of the above-mentioned funds, then
you can [donate directly to Brink through your DAF][Brink DAF].

If youâ€™d like to learn more about the ways a DAF fund might be useful
in your giving portfolio, contact [donate@brink.dev][donate email] or the
investment manager of your DAF.

### Donate Bitcoin Directly to Brink

If you'd like to donate Bitcoin directly to Brink, while receiving the tax
benefit, then here are some general steps needed to complete the process.
Please note that is for information purposes only and is not tax advice!

1. Consult with a tax professional who is familiar with your individual tax
   situation. They can guide you through this process such as completing the
   required [IRS Form 8283][IRS Form 8283].

2. Email [donate@brink.dev][donate email] to let us know the amount you'd like
   to donate and your contact information (necessary for our bookkeeping and
   compliance requirements).

3. We will email you an invoice with payment options.

4. If the donation amount exceeds $5,000, contact a qualified appraiser before
   the completion of Part 1 of Form 8283. Two firms that offer appraisal of
   cryptocurrency assets are [Charitable Solutions LLC][Charitable Solutions LLC]
   and [Crypto Appraisers][Crypto Appraisers]. This is not an endorsement of these
   firms! As with any financial transaction, you should consult a professional to
   guide you.

5. Once the form has been completed by the appraiser, send it to
   [donate@brink.dev][donate email]. We'll fill out part V of the form and
   return to you. Your tax professional can guide you on next steps.

### Anonymous Donations

Small donations of Bitcoin can be made through the [donation page][] on our
website, both through an onchain and Lightning payments. When donating
anonymously, you will not be able to claim the donation as a tax deduction.

Our mission is to _Strengthen Bitcoin by Supporting Bitcoin Developers_.
100% of donations go towards our [grant][] and [fellowship][] programs to
advance that mission. Thank you for your interest in supporting Brink!
