Brink is proud to support [Eugene Siegel][eugene github] as an open source
engineer contributing to Bitcoin Core. With a background as a security engineer
working on the Lightning Network and having already disclosed multiple Bitcoin
Core security vulnerabilities, we are excited about how Eugene will help ensure the
long-term security, resilience, and decentralization of Bitcoin.

As a full-time engineer, Eugene will focus on improving Bitcoin Core’s security and
robustness through enhanced [fuzz testing](/blog/2023/07/14/fuzzing/).

I’ve been passionate about cybersecurity from a young age. When I was 13, my
best friend in middle school introduced me to SQL injection, sparking my
curiosity. In August, 2013, when I was 16, I successfully begged my mom to bring
me to DEFCON 21 in Las Vegas, where I first discovered Bitcoin. However, it
wasn't until 2016 that I began  contributing seriously, working on a CoinShuffle
implementation.

Since then, I have worked on various Bitcoin-related security projects,
including bringing zero-conf channels to the Lightning Network, patching
vulnerabilities in LND, and responsibly disclosing security issues in projects
such as LDK
([1](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#security-10))
and Bitcoin Core
([1](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/block-stalling-issue-in-core-prior-to-v22-0/499),
[2](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2024/07/31/disclose-addrman-int-overflow/)).

With support from Brink, I'll be focusing on improving fuzzing coverage in
*net_processing*, particularly in [compact blocks](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/compact-block-relay/) processing. My work will
involve writing and reviewing fuzz tests, optimizing existing code to be more
fuzzer-friendly, and ensuring tests run efficiently.  Strengthening Bitcoin’s
fuzzing infrastructure is a crucial step in making Bitcoin Core's complex state
machines more resilient to unexpected conditions.

I think Bitcoin Core is leading the way in fuzzing in the industry, and I hope
to contribute to its role as a model for other projects looking to apply fuzzing
techniques effectively in their own domains.
