This month, we’re excited to celebrate a significant milestone—Hennadii
Stepanov’s (hebasto) four-year anniversary as an open source Bitcoin engineer at
Brink. Over these years, he has proven himself an invaluable developer,
achieving [a prolific number of
contributions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/graphs/contributors) to
Bitcoin Core and its GUI repository.

## A Simple Bugfix

Hebasto's journey began when he encountered a bug as an end user of the Bitcoin
Core software. He was running Bitcoin Core on an old laptop in pruned mode and
noticed a discrepancy between the documentation and the actual behaviour of the software
and took the initiative to [fix
it](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13844).

For hebasto, this is the moment when he became a true Bitcoiner. This simple act
led him to become an ongoing Bitcoin Core contributor, amassing over 1,800 code
commits since that original bug fix.

## Prioritizing the End User

Hebasto's work on Bitcoin Core has always been
guided by his focus on the end user’s needs, ensuring the software remains
practical, user-friendly, and accessible.

He believes that for any software to truly function, three accessibility
elements are necessary:

1. **Accessible Hardware:** Ensuring that people have the means to run the
   software.
2. **Skilled Operation:** Empowering individuals—no matter their technical
   background—with the skills needed to operate Bitcoin Core software on the
   hardware and operating system of their choice.
3. **Language:** End users being able to run the software in their own native
   language.

Hebasto's ongoing efforts have been aimed at making Bitcoin secure, accessible,
and user-friendly.

## Key Milestones & Achievements

* **2018, August:** [First
  contribution](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/312ff01ee533fab68348283200eb57e9956fdb34) to Bitcoin Core
* **2020:** Introduced [anchor P2P
  connections](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17428) to mitigate certain types of [eclipse
  attacks](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/eclipse-attacks/)
* **2020:** Received his first sponsorship from [Cardcoins](https://blog.cardcoins.co/a-year-in-review-hennadii-stepanovs-contributions-to-bitcoin-core)
* **2021, March:** Awarded [his first grant from
  Brink](https://brink.dev/blog/2021/04/22/hennadii-bitcoin-core/) in recognition of his work
* **2021, April:** Entrusted with the responsibility for overseeing the Bitcoin Core GUI
  repository as a maintainer
* **2022, March:** Joined Brink's office in London office to collaborate in person
* **2024:** Completed the [migration of Bitcoin Core’s build system to CMake](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2024/09/06/#bitcoin-core-30454)

## Project Leadership

Hebasto’s regular contributions also led to taking a leadership role over
several projects:

* **GUI Modernization:** Initially focused on improving the Bitcoin Core GUI,
  his interests soon expanded to address multi-threading issues. This led him to
  co-initiate a project alongside other developers and designers to create a
  modern, multi-platform GUI.
    * [https://bitcoincore.app/](https://bitcoincore.app/)
    * [https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui-qml](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui-qml)
* **Build System Overhaul:** Recognizing the limitations of Bitcoin
  Core’s Autotools-based build system (in use since 2013), hebasto launched a
  project to migrate the system to a modern, CMake-based build system, enhancing
  efficiency and paving the way for future development. The migration to CMake
  took nearly 300 pull requests, a dozen people, and two years of review and
  testing.
* **Translation Improvements**: Hebasto drove the move to a modern translation format which
  allows code developers comments, to translators to better understand the
  context of translatable text in Bitcoin Core.
