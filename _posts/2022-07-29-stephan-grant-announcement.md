Technology has always been my passion. I started my career at a sustainability
data startup where I was able to develop my software engineering skills. After
coming to better understand its potential, I made the switch to start
working on Bitcoin fully since the fall of 2021. Since then, I've participated
in and hosted some of the [Chaincode seminars][], [contributed][stephan github]
to Bitcoin Core mostly through reviewing and hosted several [Bitcoin Core PR Review
Clubs][]. Most recently, I was a mentor for the first [Qala][] cohort.

Thanks to this Brink grant, I will continue to review and contribute new code to
Bitcoin Core and related projects. Besides general code quality and
maintainability, I will continue with improvements on the Core REST API and I
would like to start focusing on improving support for Miniscript. In addition to
my development work, I will continue to spend time to help grow the ecosystem
that ensures the robustness of Bitcoin over time through the education of
(potential) Bitcoin developers and builders, focusing on both the Bitcoin
protocols as well as applications on top of it.
