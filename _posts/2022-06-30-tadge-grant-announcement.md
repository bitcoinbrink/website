Since first learning about Bitcoin in 2011 I've been fascinated by
what it could become.  Despite the seemingly unchangeable rules of the
Bitcoin network, it's still an open question how Bitcoin will evolve.

My work in the Bitcoin space has been to develop and co-author the
Lightning Network with Joseph Poon back in 2015, and founding and
working at Lightning Labs.  I started working at the MIT Digital
currency initiative in 2017, developing [Discreet Log Contracts][optech dlcs], and
teaching a class about Bitcoin's technical underpinnings with DCI
director Neha Narula.  In the last few years I have been working on
[Utreexo][optech utreexo], a way of making fully validating Bitcoin nodes smaller and
faster, so that people can more easily get the privacy and security of
running a node.

Working at Brink part time I'm excited to continue my work on Utreexo,
as well as working with people new to Bitcoin development and helping
them get up to speed.  While I'm still working with students at MIT,
that work tends to be more academic and theoretically oriented, and I
hope to work with Brink grantees on more applied development work.  I
hope to be able to expand Bitcoin's functionality and welcome the
researchers and progrogrammers who will continue to do that with us at
Brink!
