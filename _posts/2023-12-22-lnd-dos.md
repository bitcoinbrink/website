In this post [Niklas Gögge][niklas github] provides a writeup of two responsibly disclosed
denial-of-service bugs he discovered in the LND software in 2021.

This is the security-focused Bitcoin research and development work that Brink is proud
to support.

_Discussion of these bugs is also available on the [Delving Bitcoin][] forum._

This is a write-up of two denial-of-service bugs I found in [LND][] at the end
of 2021. Users do not need to take any action at this time, as the initial fixed
versions are themselves superseded due to other [exploited][] and [disclosed][]
vulnerabilities.

## (1) Premature channel_update denial-of-service

LND prior to [v0.14.0][] was vulnerable to denial-of-service by running out of
memory from unconditionally storing premature channel updates.

### Details

When a channel is first established between two parties, three gossip messages
will be broadcast to the network: a `channel_announcement` and two `channel_updates`
(one for each channel direction). During the propagation of these messages, a
race may occur in which the channel updates are received prior to the channel
announcement. The receiving node can not validate these premature channel
updates, as the channel announcement contains the public keys that correspond to
the signatures in the updates.

To address this race, LND used a buffer for temporarily storing premature
channel updates until the channel announcement is received. Unfortunately the
size of this buffer was unbounded and an attacker could fill it with entirely
invalid updates, leading the victim to run out of memory. As with any crash bug
in Lightning node software, this comes with **a risk of loosing funds**.

The issue was fixed in [PR #5902][] by replacing the unbounded buffer with a
limited cache that can hold up to 100 premature updates.

Fun fact: The issue was [fixed][lnd 4895] earlier in Jan. 2021 by removing the buffer
entirely but it is unclear whether or not that was intentional, as the fix was
later [rolled back][lnd 5003] due to flaky tests.

## (2) channel_update signature validation after rate limiting

LND prior to [v0.15.0][] was vulnerable to channel update gossip censorship.

### Details

In the Lightning protocol, there is no inherent cost to creating and
broadcasting `channel_update` messages besides having to sign them. To address
this, all Lightning implementations rate limit how many channel updates they
will relay within a given time frame (to prevent gossip spam on the network).

LND used to check signatures of channel updates after applying its relay rate
limits. As consequence, an attacker could censor channel updates for any channel
from propagating by creating invalid channel updates and spamming them to LND
nodes (causing any new valid updates from the victim to be ignored).

The issue was fixed in [PR #6278][] by ensuring that signature validation of
channel updates happens prior to applying the rate limits.

## Timelines

Disclosure timeline for both bugs:

- 19-10-2021: Initial disclosure to Lightning Labs
- 05-11-2021: (1) fixed: [https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5902][lnd 5902]
- 17-11-2021: v0.14.0 released
- 16-03-2022: (2) fixed: [https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6278][lnd 6278]
- 24-06-2022: v0.15.0 released
- 21-12-2023: Public disclosure
