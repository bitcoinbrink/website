If you shop on Amazon, you can support Brink at the same time by using
[AmazonSmile][]. When using [AmazonSmile][], 0.5% of eligible purchases will be donated
to a charitable organization of your choice.

If you're reading this blog, then you're probably interested in supporting open
source Bitcoin development. Now you can do that while doing your shopping!

Only purchases made at smile.amazon.com will result in donations.

### How to use AmazonSmile

* On desktop: [Bookmark this link][AmazonSmile], select Brink Technology Inc as
  your chosen charity, and use smile.amazon.com for your future Amazon
  purchases.  You may also want to install a browser extension that
  automatically redirects any Amazon links you click to the Smile
  subdomain.  See extensions for [Firefox][ff smile] and [Chrome][chrome
  smile].

* On mobile: turn on AmazonSmile by going to “Settings” in the main menu,
  select “AmazonSmile,” and following the on-screen instructions. Search for
  the Brink Technology Inc when choosing a charity.
