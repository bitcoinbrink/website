Today, we’re proud to announce our latest Brink fellow. Marco De Leon (GitHub
[marcofleon][marco github], Twitter [macrohead7][marco twitter]) has joined
Brink in our London office to work full time on Bitcoin Core development.

For the next year, Marco will contribute to Bitcoin Core's fuzz testing
initiatives, in addition to general Bitcoin Core testing and review. He will be mentored
by Niklas Gögge and will help build out Bitcoin Core's fuzz testing
infrastructure.

The importance of fuzz testing and some of the results from it are covered in
previous discussions:

- [Matt Morehouse on Fuzz Testing the Lightning Network][blog morehouse fuzzing ln]

## About Marco

Marco was born in Sevilla, Spain and grew up in Phoenix, Arizona. He fell down
the Bitcoin rabbit hole in 2021 and has been falling ever since. After
completing the both the Chaincode Seminars and the Chaincode Bitcoin FOSS
program, he started contributing to the Bitcoin Core project in March 2024 and
has reviewed over 25 PRs and had 2 of his own PRs merged. His primary focus will
be on fuzz testing, with the goal of expanding coverage, adding useful oracles,
and identifying vulnerabilities.
